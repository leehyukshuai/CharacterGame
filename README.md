# Character Game by C++

## Instructions

1. You can add new files named `xx.img` to add new images, and the content of the file should be as follows: Initially two integers, which present height and width of the image respectively, and then follows height lines, which is the main part of the image, and the file should end up with an enter.
2. You can edit the `program.cpp` to add new actors and modify the `Init()`, `Handle()` and `Update()` functions.
3. Finally, enter `make` in your terminal (make sure you have added the `make` tool to `PATH`).
4. Then you will get `game.exe`, that is what we want.
